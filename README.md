# SQL-Nested-Set-Move-Subtree
https://natethedba.wordpress.com/the-nested-set-model/

A set of sample scripts for implementing and testing the "Move Subtree" operation on a Nested Set Model table named `NsmCat`, as discussed in the blog post above.  Includes a "setup" script (create table & fill with sample data), the "proc" script (create the stored procedure for moving a subtree), and an "advanced" script (adds `Depth` and `Sort` columns and shows how to use them to preview/verify tree structure after operations).

I ask politely for attribution if you found this helpful, but I'd settle for an upvote on SO and/or a comment/follow on my blog!  Cheers.
